1. create a new twitter acount or use your personal one.
2. go to the settings then click on apps and register it to get the 4 codes you uses at the to of the program.
3. once this is linked up go to http://www.last.fm/api and create an account to gain API access.
4. you will put the api code into the part where it says API_KEY IN  url = 'http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&user=leavenstee&limit=1&api_key=API_KEYa&format=json'
5. after that yu can start listening to music and run the code.
